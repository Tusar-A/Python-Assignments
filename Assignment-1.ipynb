    "In programming, there is a naming convention for defining variables. In python, by convension the variable name should be start with any character or underscore, but at the beggining there can't be any integer. Here, variable 'eggs' starts with 'e' which is a character or string type. On the other hand variable '100' which starts with '1' which is not valid by convension. This is why eggs is valid variable while 100 is invalid."
